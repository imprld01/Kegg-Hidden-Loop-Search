# Kegg-Hidden-Loop-Search

Hidden regulatory relationship for a loop on gene regulation networks  
are not completely revealed for most of biological pathway database.  
Hence, we hope to construct a program that can find the hidden loops back.

This project is an example about how to use the library, Feedback_Loop_Search.jar.  
Hoping this can help you using lib to write your own program, according to your needs.  
The program applied kegg database as the main resource for searching hidden loops.

If you are interested in the methodology of searching hidden loops on kegg database.  
[Here]() you can find the document about the methodology.

If there is any problem, you can send email to [me](mailto:sbw%32%3319@g%6D%61il.%63%6F%6D).

Thanks a lot! ☺️

# KGI

The searching is based on KGI, which is an integrated database on kegg database.

* You can find KGI immediately in this repository under **res** directory.
  * retrieved on 2017/05/07
  * species: **ko**(KEGG Orthology)
  * place KGI in specific directory(~/Database/Kgml_Information/ko/)
